# iotkit-agent
TEST RODO3

The IoT Kit Agent abstracts complexities of Cloud connectivity. It allows developers to focus on application development and logic for their devices (sensors, actuators and tags). IoT Kit Agent transparently implements the necessary message format and security during both the device registration and data submission.

## Installation

Install using npm:

    npm install iotkit-agent
    mv node_modules/iotkit-agent ./
    
Once you have a copy of the iotkit-agent locally, execute the setup script:

    cd iotkit-agent
    ./setup-agent.sh
    
> You only have to run the setup once
    
### Configuration

The iotkit-agent, by default, has sufficient defaults to register itself in the Cloud.
    
> You can configure many parameters of the iotkit-agent in the config file located in the root folder, but, unless you are sure you know what they mean, these are best left unchanged.
        
### Start

To start the iotkit-agent service simply execute the start script:

    ./start-agent.sh
    
### Stop

Yep, you quest it, run the stop script:

    ./stop-agent.sh

## Usage

For instructions how to use the iotkit-agent please the [iotkit-samples repo](https://github.com/enableiot/iotkit-samples).

## Test

    mocha

## Certificates

> Do not use the default certificates in production

The IoT Kit Agent includes default certificates to provide "out of the box" connectivity. These are fine for public data submissions but should not be used for production deployments.
